# Codebase of RCNN

### Introduction.
I created this repo to pratice implementing RCNN framework and inspired by detectron2(https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) and mmdet(https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) we decided to create a container where we can implement object detection api and implement different models. If you wanted to join and contribute with us, just drop a email at usamahasan72@gmail.com. 

#### The repo is currently in the development phase.

##### TODO:
        1. Fix and Update NMS Method One that should be Generic for all the base detector.
        2. The current issues are with Bounding Box scaling, NMS , XYWH 2 XYXY . 
        3. Implement Faster-RCNN.
        4. Implement video reader in io.
        5. Add support for building Custom YOLO using resnet backbone.
        6. Implement Anchor Generator.
